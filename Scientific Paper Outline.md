## **Abstract (150–250 words)**

* **Motivation**: The growing demand for intelligent agents capable of querying structured data using natural language.
* **Objective**: Propose a prompt-engineered LLM-based agent that simulates a database administrator.
* **Method**: Use prompt engineering strategies to guide LLMs in understanding schema, generating SQL, and performing data analysis.
* **Results**: Achieves high accuracy in SQL generation and data interpretation across multiple benchmarks.
* **Contribution**: A generalizable framework for building natural language-to-SQL agents using prompting.

## **1. Introduction**

* **Context**: Rise of LLMs in structured data interaction; need for natural language interfaces for SQL databases.
* **Problem Statement**: Traditional text-to-SQL approaches struggle with schema generalization and contextual understanding.
* **Research Gap**: Limited work on leveraging prompt engineering to build schema-aware agents for both query generation and analytical reasoning.
* **Goal**: Introduce a prompt engineering framework to turn LLMs into autonomous SQL agents.
* **Contributions**:

  * A modular prompting architecture for SQL generation and data analysis.
  * A dataset of natural language tasks mimicking real-world DBA responsibilities.
  * Quantitative and qualitative evaluation across multiple databases.
* **Structure**: Outline of the rest of the paper.

## **3. Problem Formulation**

* Define the **input**: natural language task + database schema.
* Define the **output**: SQL query and optional natural language explanation.
* Formalization of agent behavior as a prompt-driven state machine (e.g., understanding intent → generating SQL → interpreting results).
* Assumptions:

  * Structured relational databases with defined schema.
  * Agent has read-only access and can invoke SQL queries.

## **4. System Design & Prompt Engineering Approach**

### 4.1 System Overview

* Architecture diagram: LLM + prompt controller + SQL execution engine.
* Flow: User query → Prompt crafting → SQL generation → Execution → Result analysis.

### 4.2 Prompting Strategy

* **Schema Injection**: Embed schema info in the prompt.
* **Intent Detection**: Classify whether the task is about querying, summarization, correlation, etc.
* **SQL Construction Prompts**: Modular prompts with examples, constraints, and feedback loops.
* **Multi-step Reasoning**: Use chain-of-thought prompting for analytical queries.

### 4.3 Tools and Language Model

* Model: Gemini
* Backend: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.
* Optional: Integration with retrieval augmentation (e.g., schema docs).

## **5. Dataset & Tasks**

### 5.1 Dataset Creation

* Sources: Public databases (e.g., Chinook, IMDB, AdventureWorks).
* Tasks: Querying, anomaly detection, summarization, comparison.

### 5.2 Task Types

* **Descriptive**: “What are the top 5 selling products?”
* **Diagnostic**: “Why did sales drop last month?”
* **Predictive**: “What are likely trends for next quarter?” (optional, with limitations)
* **Analytical Reasoning**: “Compare monthly growth between two regions.”

### 5.3 Annotation and Ground Truth

* Manual SQL annotations, expected outputs, and evaluation metrics.

## **6. Experiments**

### 6.1 Evaluation Metrics

* **SQL Accuracy**: Exact match, execution accuracy.
* **Result Accuracy**: Alignment with ground truth.
* **Task Success Rate**: Did the agent fulfill the user’s intent?
* **Human Evaluation**: Fluency, helpfulness, correctness.

### 6.2 Baselines

* Text-to-SQL models (e.g., Spider finetuned T5, SQL-PaLM).
* Retrieval-augmented agents (e.g., LangChain, AutoGPT).
* Non-agent LLM prompting (e.g., raw GPT-4 with no prompting strategy).

### 6.3 Quantitative Results

* Tables comparing accuracy, robustness, generalization across databases.

### 6.4 Qualitative Case Studies

* Examples of correct, partially correct, and failed agent queries.
* Insightful discussion on errors and misinterpretations.
