We have encountered a deviation from the expected outcome or a point of uncertainty. I require you to execute the following structured problem-solving and action planning protocol:

1.  **Problem Statement Definition:**
    *   Based on the current context, my previous request, and any errors or unexpected results observed, explicitly define the precise problem or knowledge gap you are currently facing.

2.  **Root Cause Analysis (Leveraging Reasoning):**
    *   Conduct a thorough analysis to identify the most probable root cause(s) of the defined problem. Consider factors such as:
        *   Misinterpretation of my previous instructions.
        *   Incorrect assumptions made.
        *   Data inconsistencies or limitations.
        *   Tool usage errors or limitations.
        *   Logical flaws in the previous plan.
    *   State your deduced root cause(s).

3.  **Goal Reaffirmation:**
    *   Briefly restate my original, overarching goal for this interaction (e.g., "[briefly restate your initial objective, like 'retrieve sales data for Q1 for X product']"). This is to ensure your plan aligns with it.

4.  **Proposed Action Plan Formulation:**
    *   Develop a new, step-by-step action plan designed to:
        a.  Directly address the identified root cause(s).
        b.  Progress towards achieving the reaffirmed goal.
    *   Each step in your plan must be concrete, actionable, and logical.
    *   For each step, specify:
        *   The action to be taken.
        *   (If applicable) The specific tool you intend to use.
        *   (If applicable) The information you expect to gain or the state you expect to achieve.

5.  **Rationale for the Plan:**
    *   For the overall action plan, provide a concise justification explaining *why* you believe this sequence of steps is the most effective and logical path forward, given your root cause analysis and the reaffirmed goal.

Please present your response clearly, addressing each of the five points above in sequence.
