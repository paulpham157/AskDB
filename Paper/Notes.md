##### `Specific Text-to-SQL Benchmark`
*Example: "the Spider benchmark and a custom dataset of complex analytical queries tailored for financial data analysis (FinanceBench)" or "the BIRD benchmark focusing on execution with diverse SQL constructs."*

##### `Specific Set of DBA Scenarios/Tasks`
*Example: "a curated suite of 20 common PostgreSQL administration tasks covering areas like performance diagnostics (e.g., index suggestion, slow query analysis), user and security management (e.g., role creation, permission auditing), and backup/recovery procedure generation" or "simulated database failure scenarios to evaluate recovery assistance."*

##### `Key Quantitative Result for Text-to-SQL`       
*Example: "85% execution accuracy on complex queries within FinanceBench, outperforming the GPT-4 baseline by 10 percentage points" or "a 90% exact match accuracy on the Spider development set."*

##### `Key Quantitative Result for Admin Tasks`
*Example: "successfully automates 90% of the defined administrative tasks with 95% correctness in generated scripts/commands, reducing estimated manual effort by an average of 30 minutes per task compared to manual execution" or "identified critical security misconfigurations in 5 out of 5 test scenarios."*
