## **Abstract**

Interacting effectively with relational databases presents significant challenges for users with varying expertise, from formulating complex analytical queries to performing intricate administrative tasks. Current solutions often address either natural language querying or specific automation for database administration (DBA) tasks, lacking a unified, intelligent interface. This paper introduces **AskDB**, a novel LLM-powered agent designed to bridge this gap by providing comprehensive, autonomous support for diverse SQL database interactions, including both data analysis and simplified database administration through natural language. AskDB leverages **Gemini 2.0 Flash** large language model and incorporates key innovations: a **dynamic schema-aware prompting mechanism** (potentially enhanced by semantic search for schema elements) that intelligently utilizes database metadata, and a **task decomposition framework**. This framework enables AskDB to handle complex administrative operations by intelligently planning and executing multi-step actions, which includes capabilities like **auto-debugging generated SQL and autonomously performing real-time internet searches** to gather necessary information, research syntax, refine solutions, and even more. We demonstrate the efficacy of AskDB through extensive experiments on `Specific Text-to-SQL Benchmark` for data interaction, and `Specific Set of DBA Scenarios/Tasks` for administrative functions. Results show that AskDB achieves `Key Quantitative Result for Text-to-SQL` and `Key Quantitative Result for Admin Tasks`. 

The primary contributions of this work include: 
1. AskDB, a unified agent architecture effectively integrating natural language data analysis and relational database administration capabilities.
2. Novel methodologies for schema-aware prompting and an orchestrated, resourceful agentic framework for database interaction, incorporating features like auto-debugging and internet-augmented problem-solving.
3. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrating AskDB's proficiency across both complex analytical query generation and practical database administration scenarios. This research paves the way for more intuitive, efficient, and democratized access to, and management of, relational database systems.

## 2. Introduction

Relational databases are the backbone of modern information systems, safeguarding vast quantities of data crucial for organizational operations and strategic decision-making. However, the primary means of interacting with these databases, Structured Query Language (SQL), often presents a significant barrier, limiting the ability of many potential users to directly access and leverage this valuable data. This section outlines the multifaceted challenges in database interaction and administration, establishes the pressing need for a more intuitive solution, and introduces our proposed LLM-powered agent, AskDB, along with its key contributions.

### 2.1. Motivation & Background

The difficulties associated with SQL and database management are pervasive, affecting a wide spectrum of users from non-technical staff to seasoned IT professionals. These challenges often lead to inefficiencies, underutilization of data assets, and increased operational burdens.

First, for many non-technical users, business analysts, and decision-makers, the **steep SQL learning curve and inherent schema complexity** are primary deterrents. Studies and observations consistently highlight that SQL syntax and the need to understand database structures pose significant hurdles. Understanding the correct syntax and navigating potentially hundreds of tables and their relationships is a formidable task, leading to frustration and a reluctance to engage with data directly. Consequently, this creates **operational bottlenecks and a heavy dependency on technical intermediaries**. Business users requiring data for timely decisions often face delays waiting for IT departments or data analysts to fulfill their requests, hindering agility and the adoption of a truly data-driven culture. Improving data accessibility has been shown to significantly enhance decision-making and operational efficiency.

Second, on the operational side, Database Administrators (DBAs) are frequently encumbered by a multitude of **repetitive and time-consuming tasks**. Routine activities such as health checks, user account management, applying standard permissions, and basic performance monitoring, while essential for system stability and security, consume a significant portion of their time. This operational load detracts from more strategic responsibilities like robust database design, proactive performance optimization, security hardening, and long-term capacity planning.

Third, even for users proficient in SQL, such as data analysts, data scientists, and software developers, **crafting and optimizing complex data queries** for large, multifaceted datasets remains a non-trivial challenge. Writing efficient queries involving multiple joins, nested subqueries, and advanced functions requires deep expertise and can be error-prone and time-consuming. Debugging such queries or adapting them to evolving business requirements further adds to the complexity and development lifecycle. The performance of these queries is critical, as poorly optimized queries can lead to significant system slowdowns.

Finally, all technical staff involved with databases, particularly DBAs, face the constant **struggle of keeping pace with and managing evolving, complex database environments**. The rapid advancements in database technologies, the proliferation of cloud-native database services, diverse data models, and stringent security compliance mandates necessitate continuous learning and adaptation. The sheer scale of data, often termed "Big Data," further amplifies these issues, overwhelming traditional relational databases and demanding new management strategies.

The confluence of these challenges—ranging from basic data access for novices to intricate management for experts—highlights a clear need for more intelligent, accessible, and efficient ways to interact with and administer database systems.

Fortunately, the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transformative opportunity to address these long-standing issues. LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, complex reasoning, and, crucially, code generation, including SQL. Their ability to process natural language instructions and translate them into structured queries, or even sequences of administrative commands, opens up new paradigms for human-computer interaction with databases. This has led to a resurgence of interest in Natural Language Interfaces to Databases (NLIDBs), now supercharged by the power and flexibility of LLMs, aiming to democratize data access and streamline database operations.

### 2.2. Problem Statement

Despite the promise of LLMs, a significant gap remains in providing a holistic, intelligent, and autonomous solution that seamlessly bridges the interaction divide for a diverse range of database-related tasks. There is a pressing need for an agent that not only assists non-technical users in querying data through natural language but also empowers technical users and DBAs by simplifying complex query generation, offering insights from data, and aiding in multifaceted database administration tasks. Such an agent must understand user intent across these varied domains, interact intelligently with database schemas, generate accurate and safe operations, and function with a useful degree of autonomy.

### 2.3. Proposed Solution - High-Level Overview

To address these challenges, this paper introduces **AskDB**, a novel LLM-powered agent designed for simplified relational database administration and data analysis using natural language interaction. AskDB leverages the capabilities of the **Gemini 2.0 Flash** large language model to act as a versatile assistant for a wide array of database tasks.

AskDB's core design provides dual capabilities:

1.  **Data Interaction Assistant:**
    *   **Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL):** Accurately translates user questions posed in natural language into executable SQL queries.
    *   **Data Summarization & Insight Generation:** Processes query results to provide concise summaries or highlight potential insights.
    *   **Data Checking & Validation Assistance:** Helps users formulate queries to check data quality or validate assumptions.
    *   **Schema Exploration Support:** Enables users to ask questions about the database schema itself (e.g., "What tables contain customer information?").

2.  **Database Administration Co-pilot:**
    *   **Simplified Task Execution:** Assists with common DBA tasks like user management (creating users, granting permissions), performance monitoring (identifying slow queries, suggesting index creation based on workload patterns), and security checks (auditing permissions, identifying potential misconfigurations).
    *   **Script Generation & Explanation:** Generates administrative scripts (e.g., for backup procedures, schema migrations) and can explain the purpose and function of existing scripts or database commands.
    *   **Troubleshooting Assistance:** Aids in diagnosing common database issues by interpreting error messages or analyzing logs, leveraging its knowledge base and real-time search capabilities.

AskDB is built upon key design principles including **accuracy** in SQL generation and task execution, **user-centricity** in its conversational interaction, **safety** mechanisms particularly for administrative operations (e.g., generating commands for review before execution), **adaptability** to different SQL dialects and database schemas through dynamic schema-aware prompting, and **resourcefulness** via its task decomposition framework and ability to perform internet searches for up-to-date information or troubleshooting.

### 2.4. Novelty & Contributions

This research makes several key contributions to the field of AI-driven database interaction:

1.  **Unified Agent Architecture (AskDB):** We propose and implement AskDB, a novel agent architecture that cohesively integrates natural language-driven data analysis with relational database administration capabilities within a single framework. This contrasts with most existing systems that typically focus on either Text-to-SQL or specific AI-driven DBA automation tools in isolation.
2.  **Advanced Methodologies for LLM-Database Interaction:** We introduce and evaluate novel techniques for enhancing LLM performance in the database context, specifically:
    *   A **dynamic schema-aware prompting mechanism** that intelligently incorporates relevant schema information (tables, columns, types, relationships, and descriptions, potentially enhanced by semantic search for schema elements) into the LLM's context for more accurate SQL generation and schema understanding.
    *   A **task decomposition framework (agent orchestration)** enabling AskDB to handle complex multi-step administrative operations, perform auto-debugging of generated SQL, and autonomously utilize tools like real-time internet search to gather necessary information or refine solutions.
3.  **Comprehensive Multi-faceted Evaluation:** We conduct a thorough evaluation of AskDB across diverse tasks, demonstrating its proficiency in both complex analytical query generation (using `[Specific Text-to-SQL Benchmark]`) and practical database administration scenarios (using `[Specific Set of DBA Scenarios/Tasks]`). This provides a holistic view of the agent's capabilities and its advantages over relevant baselines.
4.  **Demonstration of Broader Applicability:** Our work showcases the potential of advanced LLM agents to significantly simplify and democratize a wider range of interactions with complex software systems beyond just Text-to-SQL, particularly in system administration and operational support.
